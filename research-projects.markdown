The GREASE project has been a collaborative effort that brought together researchers and eminent scholars from Europe, South & Southeast Asia, Asia Pacific, and the MENA region. Over the course of four years, the consortium conducted extensive research to investigate how religious diversity is governed in more than two dozen countries. By comparing norms, laws, and practices, the project aimed to identify valuable lessons that the West could learn from other parts of the world when it comes to governing religious diversity and preventing religious radicalization. Additionally, the research provided valuable insights into different societal approaches to accommodating religious minorities and migrants. By embracing the lessons learned from other parts of the world, the West can work towards building a more inclusive, tolerant, and cohesive society that respects the rights of religious minorities and fosters harmonious coexistence. The project's findings can serve as a foundation for developing effective policies and practices that promote religious pluralism and social cohesion.


**RESULTS:**

***Religious radicalization in Russia: the drivers and the state's response (Chapter in an edited volume)***

My findings demonstrate that the analysis of religious radicalization in Russia tends to primarily focus on Islamist radicalization. While there are other political and religious groups that may also exhibit radicalized tendencies, the attention of the public, politicians, and researchers remains predominantly fixated on Islam and the North Caucasus region. This focus can be attributed to three main reasons.
Firstly, the emphasis on Islamist radicalization aligns with the global trend that associates the current wave of terrorism, often referred to as "new," "fourth," or "religious" terrorism, with Islam and the broader global war against it.
Secondly, the Islamization and subsequent radicalization of Muslims in Russia gained significant attention due to the Russo-Chechen wars of 1994-1996 and 1999-2009. These conflicts brought the issue of Islamist radicalization to the forefront, reinforcing the prevailing perception.
Thirdly, the rise of Islamic State in Syria and Iraq further contributed to the spotlight on Islamist radicalization. The actions and ideologies of this extremist group intensified concerns about the potential for radicalization among Muslims in Russia.
In conclusion, I argue that it is essential to recognize that religious radicalization in Russia is not limited solely to Islam, and there are other political and religious groups that may also pose significant concerns in this regard. A comprehensive analysis should consider all potential sources of radicalization, avoiding a disproportionate focus on any single group or region.


***Governing Religion in Russia and Bulgaria: Between Religious Diversity and Religious Nationalism (Research Article)***

Following the collapse of Communism, Bulgaria and Russia underwent significant transformations in their systems of religious governance. Adopting policies of liberalization, both states created conducive conditions for the revival of religion and the growth of religious diversity. This research article examines the state approaches and policy orientations that have shaped the governance of religious diversity in Russia and Bulgaria during the post-Communist era. Additionally, it explores the challenges faced in realizing religious freedom and religious equality within these contexts.
The collapse of Communist regimes in Bulgaria and Russia marked a turning point in the governance of religious affairs. Post-Communist policies embraced liberalization, leading to the renaissance of religious practices and the proliferation of diverse faiths. However, the shift towards liberalization was not consistent and permanent. Neither it was enabling religious communities to flourish. Both countries faced challenges in upholding religious freedom and ensuring equality among religious communities. Moreover, the policies they adopted in managing religious diversity could be labeled as restrictive, autocratic, and surprisingly similar.


***Russia: Religious Governance and Radicalization (Country Report)***

Religion can play very diverse roles in the political and mundane life of states and people. It can be a source of collective identity, it can contribute to domestic stability, and it also can strengthen the state's stance on the international arena. However, religion can be a destabilizing factor too. It can be and often is used to provoke and fuel international conflict and domestic unrest. The negative role of religion is the focus of this report, which analyses the religious radicalization in the Russian Federation.





**WORK IN PROGRESS:**

**Procreation for the sake of the nation (Book)** 

<img height="250px" src="https://marat-iliyasov.github.io/assets/img/wedding.jpg" alt="Photo of the secret wedding during war in Chechnya">

*This book is about Chechen determination to survive as a nation by growing numerically despite the war and despair.*

**Abstract**

Your country is at war, your fianc√© is hunted by enemy forces, public services are shuttered, and you have little to no possibility to earn a living... Would you plan to get married and have a child in such a situation? If you were a Chechen, you would. As I observed personally, many Chechens were opting to have a family during the 1994-1996 war with Russia that was destroying this small region in the North Caucasus. The pattern repeated during the second, even more brutal Russo-Chechen war in 1999-2009. This predisposition to have family and children that I noticed in war-torn Chechnya is confirmed by the available scholarly estimates of birth rates in Chechnya during the war and post-war demographic statistics. Statistical analysis confirms the tendency of Chechen demographic growth, which is striking and anomalous in the context of the general population decline in the Russian Federation. According to censuses and estimates, the Chechen nation grows 5-10% faster than even the neighboring North Caucasian ethnic groups, that live in similarly urbanized and almost the same economic, religious, and sociocultural environments. I attribute this phenomenon to the war-related loss, which constituted up to 20% of the Chechen population. 



**Chechen Lessons for Post-Soviet States and the World (Book)** 

<img height="250px" src="https://marat-iliyasov.github.io/assets/img/chechnya.jpg" alt="Photo of a woman mourning the victims of the Deportation during the war in Chechnya">

*This book will provide an empirically based theoretical contribution to fill the gap that exists in scholarship due to the lack of decolonial perspective from non-Russian nations on democratization of the post-Soviet Russia, which turned into neo-imperialism.*

**Abstract**

Chechnya. This geographically insignificant republic in the North Caucasus has a disproportionate political influence on the world. Many still remember how for the first time it made international news by declaring sovereignty in the early 1990s. Its political importance since then grew enormously and turned Chechnya into an object of regular discussion by world politicians, journalists, and scholars. The larger and not necessarily professional audience also associate Chechnya with either the brutality of the current puppet regime that rules the republic since the 2000s or the Russian aggression that Chechnya had to withstand twice in the 1990s and 2000s. However, this book is not only about Russia's neo-colonial wars in Chechnya. Neither it is only about the determination of the Chechen people to defend their right to be free, which they proved during approximately 250 years of confrontation with Russia. This book investigates how it happened that despite the neo-colonial war in Chechnya, the world overlooked Russian imperialism. In this book, I intend to systematize both dominant and overlooked aspects of political evolution of modern Russia through Russo-Chechen relations and the legacy of centuries-long history. I will explore the perception of modern Russia in the West and track its evolution through the analysis of archival materials. On top of this, I will present tragic efforts of the Chechen pro-independence politicians to alert the world about the resurrecting Russian neo-imperialism. 

Book outline

Political context, Chechen identity and collective memory
The first part of the book will consist of three chapters. The first chapter will examine who the Chechens and it happened that peace and war became ingrained in their collective identity and memory of the Chechens. It will analyze the history of Chechnya approached through the role of ethnic identity in the Russo-Chechen conflict and what kind of coexistence it permits with foreign rule. The chapter will include the description of Chechen collective identity and transformations that it undergone due to the conflict, assessing their depth. 

The second chapter will complement this analysis by delving into the exploration of the Chechen memory politics and clashes over different interpretations of historic events by the Chechen nationalist and federalist (pro-Russian) elites. This part will explore activities such as holding commemoration ceremonies, constructing monuments, naming and renaming streets and squares, publishing books, and producing history-related films. The period under focus starts with the declaration of Chechen independence in 1991 and continues up to date. To complete this socio-historical and cultural analysis, I will examine speeches of the Chechen (nationalist and federalist) political leaders. My particular focus will be the speeches and statements posted on YouTube and collected more than 100,000 views in Chechen and Russian languages. 

The third chapter of this part will present the Chechen population‚Äôs view of memory politics by the two conflicting elites, which is based on 149 interviews with Chechens that I collected over the last eight years. The bulk of the interviews (totalling 110) I collected in-person and online from first-generation Chechen migrants between 2014 and 2022. The remaining 39 interviews were with the Chechens who live in the homeland. 

*Three views on the conflict: US, Russian, Chechen* 

The second part will address the question of how it happened that the world overlooked Russian imperialism despite the wars in Chechnya. It will consist of four chapters. The first chapter will outline the history of post-Soviet Russia from a decolonial perspective providing the political context that characterized Russia from the 1990s up to date and present the perception of the conflict between Russia and Chechnya from three perspectives: US, Russian, and Chechen. I will argue that both wars in Chechnya were neo-imperial for Russia and decolonial for the Chechens, and that neither of these frames was accepted by the US political establishment. 

Further three chapters of this part will delve into the analysis of these perceptions in depth. First, I will explore the view of the US on the Russo-Chechen conflict approaching it through the analysis of congressional hearings on Chechnya between 1991 and the present date. Reports from agencies like the CIA on pre-war Chechnya and its aftermath will add to understanding how Chechnya and Russia were perceived during the wars and afterward. 

In the next chapter, I will analyze the views of the Russian politicians toward the Russo-Chechen conflict approaching it through their speeches delivered on the international stage and particularly in the US. The materials available at the Library of Congress will help me to explore the differences in political attitudes that existed among the Russian elite at that time and how they were communicated to the world audiences. 

The final chapter of this part is to examine the views of the Chechen politicians toward the conflict. I will approach them through analysis of political ideologies and philosophies that were promoted during the Chechen de facto independence and by the politicians in exile after Chechnya was reoccupied by Russia. I will employ data retrieved from the special collections, such as the Joan Beecher Eichrodt at Stanford University, supplementing it with the Library of Congress materials. I will also use data collected from social media and interviews with Chechens that I collected from 2014 to 2022. 

*Russian and Chechen methods of appeasement*

The third part of the book will delve into the questions of conflict and conflict management and will consist of two chapters. The first chapter will present Russian methods of recolonization that Moscow tested in Chechnya. This part will explore the evolution of Russian political strategy and use of the hybrid warfare (Chivvis 2017, Fabian 2019, R√°cz 2015). In this chapter, I will scrutinize the question of whether these methods are indeed effective in the long term. This investigation will involve the evaluation of closely related issues such as the spread of terrorism and radicalization throughout the North Caucasus, Russia, and the world, as well as the how the Chechen government legitimizes itself. 

In the second chapter of this part, I will study the question of what the local administration has been navigating trying to address the intrinsic demands of Chechen society and remaining loyal to Russia. Legitimization among Chechnya‚Äôs resident population appears to be secured through promotion of Islam, nationalism, and security (Schaefer 2010, Iliyasov 2022). Legitimization by the federal government, along with handling the security situation, rests upon branding the republic as a loyal member of the federal family, ensured through the support of the ruling party in the general elections, and manifests of personal loyalty. 

The part will reflect on the sources of stability of the Kadyrov regime such as coercion, finances, religion, and stability. These sources will be approached critically demonstrating that Chechen population continues to view Russia as a historical threat.

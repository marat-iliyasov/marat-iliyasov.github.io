EU-funded Global Research

The GREASE project has been a collaborative effort that brought together researchers and eminent scholars from Europe, South & Southeast Asia, Asia Pacific, and the MENA region. Over the course of four years, the consortium conducted extensive research to investigate how religious diversity is governed in more than two dozen countries. By comparing norms, laws, and practices, the project aimed to identify valuable lessons that the West could learn from other parts of the world when it comes to governing religious diversity and preventing religious radicalization. Additionally, the research provided valuable insights into different societal approaches to accommodating religious minorities and migrants. By embracing the lessons learned from other parts of the world, the West can work towards building a more inclusive, tolerant, and cohesive society that respects the rights of religious minorities and fosters harmonious coexistence. The project's findings can serve as a foundation for developing effective policies and practices that promote religious pluralism and social cohesion.


**RESULTS:**

***Religious radicalization in Russia: the drivers and the state's response (Chapter in an edited volume)***

My findings demonstrate that the analysis of religious radicalization in Russia tends to primarily focus on Islamist radicalization. While there are other political and religious groups that may also exhibit radicalized tendencies, the attention of the public, politicians, and researchers remains predominantly fixated on Islam and the North Caucasus region. This focus can be attributed to three main reasons.
Firstly, the emphasis on Islamist radicalization aligns with the global trend that associates the current wave of terrorism, often referred to as "new," "fourth," or "religious" terrorism, with Islam and the broader global war against it.
Secondly, the Islamization and subsequent radicalization of Muslims in Russia gained significant attention due to the Russo-Chechen wars of 1994-1996 and 1999-2009. These conflicts brought the issue of Islamist radicalization to the forefront, reinforcing the prevailing perception.
Thirdly, the rise of Islamic State in Syria and Iraq further contributed to the spotlight on Islamist radicalization. The actions and ideologies of this extremist group intensified concerns about the potential for radicalization among Muslims in Russia.
In conclusion, I argue that it is essential to recognize that religious radicalization in Russia is not limited solely to Islam, and there are other political and religious groups that may also pose significant concerns in this regard. A comprehensive analysis should consider all potential sources of radicalization, avoiding a disproportionate focus on any single group or region.


***Governing Religion in Russia and Bulgaria: Between Religious Diversity and Religious Nationalism (Research Article)***

After the collapse of Communism, a major overhaul of the systems of religious governance took place in Bulgaria and Russia. Policies of liberalization were pursued in both states which created conditions for the revival of religion and growth of religious diversity. This research article analyses the state approaches and policy orientations characterizing the governance of religious diversity in Russia and Bulgaria in the post-Communist years as well as challenges to the fulfilment of religious freedom and religious equality.

***Russia: Religious Governance and Radicalization (Country Report)***

Religion can play very diverse roles in the political and mundane life of states and people. It can be a source of collective identity, it can contribute to domestic stability, and it also can strengthen the state's stance on the international arena. However, religion can be a destabilizing factor too. It can be and often is used to provoke and fuel international conflict and domestic unrest. The negative role of religion is the focus of this report, which analyses the religious radicalization in the Russian Federation.





**WORK IN PROGRESS:**

**Procreation for the sake of the nation (Book)** 

<img height="250px" src="https://marat-iliyasov.github.io/assets/img/wedding.jpg" alt="Photo of the secret wedding during war in Chechnya">

*This book is about Chechen determination to survive as a nation by growing numerically despite the war and despair.*

**Abstract**

Your country is at war, your fianc√© is hunted by enemy forces, public services are shuttered, and you have little to no possibility to earn a living... Would you plan to get married and have a child in such a situation? If you were a Chechen, you would. As I observed personally, many Chechens were opting to have a family during the 1994-1996 war with Russia that was destroying this small region in the North Caucasus. The pattern repeated during the second, even more brutal Russo-Chechen war in 1999-2009. This predisposition to have family and children that I noticed in war-torn Chechnya is confirmed by the available scholarly estimates of birth rates in Chechnya during the war and post-war demographic statistics. Statistical analysis confirms the tendency of Chechen demographic growth, which is striking and anomalous in the context of the general population decline in the Russian Federation. According to censuses and estimates, the Chechen nation grows 5-10% faster than even the neighboring North Caucasian ethnic groups, that live in similarly urbanized and almost the same economic, religious, and sociocultural environments. I attribute this phenomenon to the war-related loss, which constituted up to 20% of the Chechen population. 



**Chechnya: the battle over the past for the sake of future (Book)** 

<img height="250px" src="https://marat-iliyasov.github.io/assets/img/chechnya.jpg" alt="Photo of a woman mourning the victims of the Deportation during the war in Chechnya">

*This book is about Chechen collective memories and their political importance for the future of Chechnya and the world.*

**Abstract**

Chechnya. This geographically insignificant republic in the North Caucasus has a disproportionate political influence on the world. Many still remember how for the first time it made international news by declaring sovereignty in the early 1990s. Its political importance since then grew enormously and turned Chechnya into an object of regular discussion by world politicians, journalists, and scholars. The larger and not necessarily professional audience also associate Chechnya with either the brutality of the current puppet regime that rules the republic since the 2000s or the Russian aggression that Chechnya had to withstand twice in the 1990s and 2000s. However, this book is not about Russia's neo-colonial wars in Chechnya, which are nonetheless discussed in it. Neither it is about the determination of the Chechen people to defend their right to be free, which they proved during approximately 250 years of confrontation with Russia. This book is about Chechen collective memories and their political importance for the future of this tiny republic and the world. In this book, I seek to achieve five goals. First, I aim to determine what historical events became or are likely to become collective memories of the Chechen nation. My second goal is to analyze how collective memories were employed by the two confronting Chechen political elites. Third, I intend to establish which collective memories are the most contested by the said political elites. Fourth, I plan to determine which of the collective memories promoted by the political elites are being accepted or most likely to be accepted by the Chechens. Based on this analysis, my last goal is to outline scenarios of the political future for Chechnya and draw the implications that fulfilment of these scenarios might have beyond the borders of the republic.

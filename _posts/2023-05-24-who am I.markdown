- Since July 2023, I start the position of a Fellow at the Global Academy at George Washington University. 

- Before that I was a Visiting Assistant Professor at Miami University of Ohio. At Miami University, my primary focus is on teaching Russian domestic and foreign politics. In my instruction, I draw upon the latest political, economic, and social analyses to provide students with up-to-date knowledge and insights.

- Prior to my tenure at Miami University, I held a post-doctoral position at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. During this time, I collaborated closely with Professor Yoshiko Herrera, delving into memory politics in Chechnya and analyzing post-Soviet Russia's strategies of warfare.
My research interests span the geographic regions of the post-Soviet space. I analyze diverse topics such as conflict and post-conflict development, political demography, autocratic legitimation, religious governance and radicalization, migrants' identity, and memory politics.

- Currently, I am immersed in the creation of my debut book, which draws upon my Ph.D. dissertation and is deeply influenced by my firsthand experiences during the first Russo-Chechen war. In this book, I undertake an analysis of the procreative motivations of Chechens in times of war, shedding light on this unique aspect of their experience.
I obtained my Ph.D. from the School of International Relations at the University of St Andrews, where I had the privilege of working closely with Professor Rick Fawn and Dr. Jeffrey Murer.

- Furthermore, I hold two MAs, one in Caucasus Studies from Ilia State University in Georgia, and another in Diplomacy and International Relations from Vilnius University in Lithuania. These diverse academic experiences have enriched my understanding of the subject matter and enhanced my multidisciplinary approach.

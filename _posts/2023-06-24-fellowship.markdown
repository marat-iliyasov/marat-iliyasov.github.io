- I am excited to embark on a new chapter in my career as a Fellow at the Global Academy of George Washington University. During this fellowship, I will be dedicating my efforts to working on my book project titled "Chechen Lessons for the West and Post-Soviet States." In this project, I aim to thoroughly analyze the political developments in Chechnya and their profound influence on contemporary Russian politics.
The recent full-scale war in Ukraine has undeniably exposed a significant epistemological gap, shedding light on the structural imperialism that underpins Russia's regime. Recognizing this, my book will make a valuable contribution by offering a comprehensive exploration of these issues, grounded in empirical evidence and guided by a theoretical framework. By doing so, it will bridge the identified gap and provide an essential political inquiry into this complex subject matter.

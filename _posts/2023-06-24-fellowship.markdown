- I am excited to announce the beginning of a new chapter in my career as a Fellow at the Global Academy of George Washington University, commencing in July 2023. During this tenure, I will be fully dedicated to advancing my book project titled "Procreation for the sake of the nation." The book asks a question, why one would get married and have a child in a situation when one's homeland is at war, there is a constant threat to one's physical existence, and from little to no possibility to earn a livingâ€¦

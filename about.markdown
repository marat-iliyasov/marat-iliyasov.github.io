# About 

<img height="250px" src="https://marat-iliyasov.github.io/assets/img/Marat.JPG" alt="Profile foto of Dr. Marat Iliyasov">

-  My professional academic work began in 2013, when I started my Ph.D. in the University of St Andrews. My MA in Caucasus Studies and International Relations were decisive in my choice of the Ph.D. program.  

-  My natural curiosity and professional guidance of my supervisors Professor Rick Fawn and Dr. Jeffrey Murer turned me into a passionate and meticulous researcher and educator. I investigate political, economic, and social issues of the wider Eurasia. 

-  Prior to starting my career in academia in 2003-2010, I worked as a journalist in national newspapers of Lithuania. This experience helped me to develop necessary discipline in writing and the skills that I employed later to work on my publications. 

-  For two years (2006-2008) I worked for the biggest think-tank in Lithuania "Center for Strategic Studies". The Center focused on analysis of wider Eurasia and provided regular consultancy services for the Government and Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Later, I also consulted the US State Department on the reasons behind the Russian invasion in Ukraine in 2022. 

-  I have some experience of working in the NGO sector. With the beginning of the second Russo-Chechen war and the influx of Chechen refugees to Lithuania in 1999, I established an NGO, which designed and implemented projects that aimed to facilitate integration of Chechen children into Lithuanian society. My experience with NGO continued in Georgia, where in 2011-2013 I worked in "Caucasian House" in the project that aimed to build communication between mid-level Georgian and Russian professionals to create a background for peace dialogue.
